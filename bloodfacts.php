                  1. Nearly 7% of the body weight of a human is made up of blood.<br>

2. Platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells are present in blood.<br>

3. Blood consists of a yellow liquid which is known as blood plasma.<br>

4. Blood plasma is primarily made up of water. 90% of blood plasma is water.<br>

5. Blood plasma also consists of hormones, glucose, proteins, gases, electrolytes and nutrients.<br>

6. Platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells are all found floating in blood plasma.<br>

7. Blood plasma can be separated using centrifuge device which spins blood at a very high speed. The cells then get collected at the bottom of the tube, separating blood plasma from the cells.<br>

8. Only the red blood cells in our blood are responsible for carrying oxygen.<br>

9. Red blood cells consist of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is actually a protein that contains iron. Oxygen combines with this iron and gives the characteristic red color to our blood as well as hemoglobin<br>.

10. Unlike red blood cells, the white blood cells in our blood form the defensive system of our body. These white blood cells are responsible for fighting viruses, bacteria and other infectious diseases. They also fight cancer cells and other unwanted material that enter human body.<br>

11. Platelets are completely different and are responsible for blood clotting whenever bleeding occurs because of a cut or bruise. This prevents unwanted loss of blood.<br>

12. While blood clotting is meant for good, it can become dangerous. If blood clots in blood vessels of heart, one can experience heart attack. Similarly, blood clot in brain can lead to stroke.<br>

13. Blood is not just responsible for carrying oxygen to different parts of the body. It also carries nutrients to body cells. At the same time, it also carries away unwanted waste material away from the cells.<br>

14. Blood pressure is actually the pressure exerted by blood on blood vessel walls. BP is a vital sign of life.<br>

15. High BP implies increased risk of stroke and heart attack.

                  <br><hr>
16. Average blood pressure will always vary from one person to another despite the fact that standard considered BP is 112/64 mmHg.<br>

17. Though we are familiar with common blood types A, B, AB and O, which is a part of simplified ABO system, there are actually around 30 different recognized blood groups or blood types.<br>

18. An adult body has 100,000 kilometers or 60,000 miles of blood vessels running throughout the body.<br>

19. The average volume of blood present in an adult male body is 5.6 liters while an adult female body contains 4.5 liters of blood on an average.<br>

20. A new born baby will have around 1 cup of blood in its body.<br>


21. Blood plasma we mentioned earlier makes up around 55% of the total volume of blood present in human body.
<br>
22. Blood consists of a special type of white blood cell known as granulocyte. These cells roll along blood vessel walls and hunt for bacteria. If they find any harmful bacteria, granulocytes will destroy these bacteria by engulfing them.<br>

23. Red blood cells survive in circulatory system for no more than 120 days.<br>

24. Platelets, plasma and red blood cells are constantly produced by bone marrow.<br>

25. Donated red blood cells cannot be stored for more than 42 days.<br>

26. Donated platelets cannot be stored for more than 5 days.<br>

27. Donated blood plasma can be stored for 1 year in frozen condition.<br>

28. Platelets, red blood cells and blood plasma can be separately <br>donated instead of donating blood as a whole. This type of donation is known as Apheresis.<br>

29. Humans can have artificial heart but there is absolutely no substitute for human blood. There is no such thing called artificial blood.<br>

30. Our body has about 0.2 mg of gold. Most of this gold is actually in our blood.<br>

31. We find pus kind of disgusting but it is actually nothing but white blood cells that died while defending our body against infections.<br>

32. The only place where blood cannot be found in human body is the cornea (eye) because cornea is capable of directly extracting oxygen from air.<br>

33. Supply of blood in blood vessels located in nose increases when someone catches cold. This happens to keep the nose warm. As a result of this blood vessels dilate and increase mucus production and leads to runny nose.
<br>
34. Scientists have come up with a method that can be used to send oxygen directly to blood without using the lungs.<br>

35. Mosquitoes have an uncanny preference to the blood type they suck. They prefer blood group O more than other blood groups.<br>

36. 1,200,000 mosquitoes together need to suck out blood once from a human body to drain out entire blood in his or her body.<br>

37. More than 400 gallons of blood are filtered by our kidneys every single day.
<br>
38. Nearly 1/4th of total cells in human body are red blood cells. So, the total number of red blood cells in an adult human body at any given point in time is around 20-30 trillion. The total number of white blood cells in an adult human body is between 4,000 and 11,000. Please remember that these numbers are just best estimates based on size and volume of the cells in comparison to total mass of an adult human body.<br>

39. Nearly 2 million red blood cells in an adult human body die every one second.<br>

40. Nearly 2 million red blood cells are produced in bone marrow every one second so that they can replace the dead cells.<br>

41. Our heart pumps 1.5 million barrels of blood during our entire lifetime. This is enough blood to completely fill 200 tank cars of train.<br>

42. Every two seconds, someone in this world will need blood.<br>

43. The donated blood is actually sold on market collecting 4.5 billion US dollars a year! That’s a huge industry.<br>

44. Donating blood never reduces a person’s physical energy.<br>

45. The amount of fluid lost when donating blood is actually replaced by our body within a few hours.<br>

46. It takes up to 4 weeks to replace the number of red blood cells lost during blood donation.<br>

47. It takes up to 8 weeks to replace the amount of iron lost after blood donation. This is precisely why a person is not allowed to donate blood twice within 8 weeks.<br>

48. On an average, an adult human body (not considering whether male or female) consists of 5 liters of blood which is equivalent to 10 pints of blood.<br>

49. One pint of blood is capable of saving 3 lives.<br>

50. If a person donates blood every 56 days (8 weeks) starting at the age of 17 and stops donating at the age of 79, he or she would donate a total of 46.5 gallons of blood, which is equivalent to 176 liters of blood.<br>
